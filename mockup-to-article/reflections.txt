  * What new skills have you learned?
  I've learned how to use markup editors along with different html tags.
  * What has been easy?
  Placing the html tags needed for this exercise.
  * What has been difficult?
  Attempting to have the exact font as the pdf example. Chrome makes the font appear a little off compared to the example.

  Yes, if I don't specifically remember a particular html tag, I will google how to implement it.
